Importing wait_random from the previous python file
written and writing an async routine called wait_n that takes in
2 int arguments (in this order): n and max_delay.
Spawn wait_random n times with the specified max_delay.
wait_n should return the list of all the delays (float values).
The list of the delays should be in ascending order without using
sort() because of concurrency.
